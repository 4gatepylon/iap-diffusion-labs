# Welcome!
This repository contains the labs for [*6.S184/6.S975: Generative AI with Stochastic Differential Equations*](https://diffusion.csail.mit.edu), as taught at MIT over IAP 2025. We will add in both the labs themselves, as well as solutions as the class progresses. Changes made to the labs over the course of the class will be noted below. Have fun :)
